      Thank you so much for taking the time to be a part of my research study. This survey is part of my individual research project, which aims to understand how university students think, solve problems, and handle challenges in their academic and personal lives. Your insights are incredibly valuable and will contribute to meaningful findings in this field. <br>

      Please rest assured that all responses will remain completely anonymous, and your participation is entirely voluntary. The survey is designed to be simple and will take only a few minutes to complete. <br>
      <br>
      I truly appreciate your support and willingness to participate. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
      <br>

      Your time and effort mean a lotâ€”thank you again!
